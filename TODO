NAVBAR

- Basic styling for main navbar (basis/justify/padding/margin)
- Responsive behavior (when hitting media queries)
- Hover dropdown navigation for the main navbar
- Language dropdown
- Animate side menu (in and out)
- Basic styling for side navbar (basis/justify/padding/margin)
- Hover for buttons
- Refactor classes (for buttons, mostly)

Navbar is probably the most difficult part of the site. Interesting one to work on
